## 50 pantry essentials for a keto lifestyle

The keto diet was [originally developed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19049574/) to reduce the severity of [epileptic seizures](https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/treating-seizures-and-epilepsy/dietary-therapies/ketogenic-diet), especially in children, but has [recently become popular](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2018/08/411526/keto-diet-gains-popularity-scientists-explain-what-we-do-and-dont-know) with people trying to lose weight and get in shape. “The diet aims to force your body into using a different type of fuel,” [Harvard Medical School](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/should-you-try-the-keto-diet) explains. “Instead of relying on sugar (glucose) that comes from carbohydrates (such as grains, legumes, vegetables, and fruits), the keto diet relies on ketone bodies, a type of fuel that the liver produces from stored fat.” Dieters get as much as 90% of their calories from fat and almost none from carbohydrates. A poorly planned keto diet could lead to nutrient deficiency and kidney, liver and digestive problems, so make sure you talk to a doctor or dietitian before going keto. This list aims to provide some inspiration for a balanced keto pantry.

## Avocados

A lot of fruits [aren’t advisable](https://www.everydayhealth.com/ketogenic-diet/diet/best-fruits-eat-on-keto-diet/) for people on a keto diet, but avocados are one delicious exception! According to [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-proven-benefits-of-avocado#TOC_TITLE_HDR_6), “while most fruit consists primarily of carbohydrates, avocado is high in healthy fats.” Avocados also contain 20 different vitamins and minerals, including more potassium than bananas, and plenty of fibre. They are loaded with heart-healthy oleic acid, the main component in olive oil. Some studies have also linked avocados to reduced cholesterol levels. If you’re looking for avocado-related inspiration in the kitchen, check out this [list of recipes](https://ketosummit.com/keto-avocado-recipes/).

## Salmon

According to Healthline, fish are “[very keto-friendly](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_2)”—low in carbohydrates and rich in vitamins and minerals. Salmon in particular is very high in omega-3 fats. Salmon and other oily fish generally support heart health and some [studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25084680/) also suggest that they can improve brain function and reduce inflammation. In addition to listing the main health benefits of salmon, [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/ingredient-focus-salmon) also provides a few [recipes](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/collection/salmon-recipes) for this delicious and [versatile fish](https://www.purewow.com/food/keto-salmon-recipes), which can be grilled, oven-roasted, pan-fried, poached, smoked or even [eaten raw](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/can-you-eat-raw-salmon#health-risks) *(NOTE: some recipes may not be keto-compliant)*.

## Eggs

[Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_7) calls eggs “one of the healthiest and most versatile foods on the planet” and “an ideal food for a ketogenic lifestyle.” Eggs are low in carbs (one egg contains less than one gram) and high in protein. It’s important to cook with whole eggs, because most of an egg’s nutrients are found in the yolk. [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/ingredient-focus-eggs) states that both the white and yolk of an egg “are rich in nutrients, including proteins, vitamins and minerals. The yolk also contains cholesterol [...] and essential fatty acids.” Eggs are also useful in weight management because “the high protein content helps us to feel fuller for longer.” Do you like your eggs scrambled, fried, boiled or cooked some other way? The [possibilities](https://www.myketokitchen.com/collections/best-keto-egg-recipes/) are endless.

## Cottage cheese

Healthline states that [most types of cheese](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_4) are appropriate for a keto diet, and provides a long list of hard and soft cheeses that fit the bill, including cottage cheese. [Cottage cheese](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/cottage-cheese-is-super-healthy) is high in many nutrients including protein, B vitamins and calcium. Higher protein and calcium intake have been associated with weight loss and the development of stronger bones and muscles. “If you’re looking to lose weight or build muscle, cottage cheese is among the most beneficial foods you can eat.” It’s also a very versatile cooking ingredient, according to [*SELF* magazine](https://www.self.com/gallery/delicious-ways-to-eat-cottage-cheese). “These mild, protein-packed curds can be used to make so many different things, from pasta and pancakes to dips and desserts.” Try some [keto recipes here](https://elevays.com/cottage-cheese-keto/).

## Coconut oil

Coconut oil has “unique properties that make it well suited for a ketogenic diet,” [Healthline explains](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_8). It contains a type of fat called medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which, unlike certain other types of fats, are “taken up directly by the liver and converted into ketones or used as a rapid source of energy.” Some studies suggest that coconut oil’s “mix of MCTs and lauric acid may promote a sustained level of ketosis” and that it might help obese adults lose belly fat. [*Saveur* magazine](https://www.saveur.com/how-to-cook-with-coconut-oil/) explains that coconut oil, which is extracted from the meat, milk or residue of coconuts, can be sold “virgin” (cold-pressed without additional processing) or refined (bleached and deodorized to create a neutral-tasting oil). [In the kitchen](https://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/best-coconut-oil-recipes/), it can be used as a substitute for butter.

## Sardines

Sardines, like salmon, are [keto-friendly](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_2), low in carbohydrates and high in omega-3s. Canned sardines are inexpensive, healthy and easy to find at most North American grocery stores. According to [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/diet/canned-sardines-good-for-you#1), they are rich in many vitamins and minerals, including vitamin B12, vitamin D and iodine. Omega-3s support heart health, and the American Heart Association recommends two servings per week of fatty fish like salmon, sardines or mackerel. Since sardines are usually consumed bones and all, they’re also a great source of calcium. [The Kitchn](https://www.thekitchn.com/14-reasons-you-should-always-have-a-can-of-sardines-in-your-pantry-224570) has a couple of good ideas for turning the canned sardines in your pantry into a delicious meal—they can be grilled or fried whole, tossed onto pizza or paired with avocado for a tasty treat *(NOTE: some recipes may not be keto-compliant)*.

## Cauliflower

[Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_3) recommends incorporating a range of low-carb vegetables into a keto diet. Cauliflower and broccoli are low in carbs and have been linked to a decreased risk of heart disease. Cauliflower is very nutrient-dense, with high levels of vitamin C and vitamin K, has anti-inflammatory properties and can help the body detox naturally, according to [Health.com](https://www.health.com/nutrition/cauliflower-benefits). Cooking blog The Spruce Eats [has many ideas](https://www.thespruceeats.com/great-ways-to-enjoy-cauliflower-3052548) for what to do with cauliflower. It can be steamed, grilled or used in salads, but also used to make a low-carb, gluten-free, [keto-friendly](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/recipes/cauliflower) rice or couscous substitute, or pressed into pizza crust, tortillas or low-carb noodles. [Cauliflower gnocchi](https://www.ibreatheimhungry.com/fathead-keto-gnocchi-low-carb/), in particular, are an intriguing low-carb alternative to the dense, potatoe-y Italian classic.

## Olives and olive oil

[Olive oil is a keto staple](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_10)—devoid of carbs, high in oleic acid (a healthy fat known to support heart health), and high in antioxidants known as phenols, which “further protect heart health by decreasing inflammation and improving artery function,” Healthline explains. In the kitchen, it doesn’t react to heat as well as some other oils, but it’s perfect for marinades and homemade mayonnaise. [Whole olives](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_15) are also on the list of low-carb, keto-friendly vegetables and add “salty, bright flavor to a variety of dishes” according to cooking website [Epicurious](https://www.epicurious.com/ingredients/our-51-best-olive-recipes-gallery). If you have a jar of olives sitting around, [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/how-use-olives) has some suggestions for how to put them to use *(NOTE: some recipes may not be keto-compliant)*.

## Green peppers

Green peppers are low-carb vegetables identified by [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_3) as keto-friendly. They’re also high in iron and “have double the amount of vitamin C by weight that oranges and other citrus fruits have,” according to [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-green-peppers#1). They’re also an “excellent” source of vitamin B6, vitamin K, potassium, vitamin E, folates and vitamin A. [Stuffed peppers](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25562593/keto-stuffed-peppers-recipe/) is an easy keto meal, but [Martha Stewart](https://www.marthastewart.com/275370/bell-pepper-recipes) has a list of 25 inspiring recipes involving bell peppers, “from dips and salads to soups and stews” *(NOTE: some recipes may not be keto-compliant).*

## Soft cheeses

Going on a keto diet is a great opportunity to try new cheeses and [recipes](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/recipes/cheese)! There are hundreds of types of cheese, and most are [high in fat and very low in carbs](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_4), making them one of the best friends a keto cook can have. Many cheeses are also rich in protein and calcium. Soft cheeses are also a [healthy choice](https://healthyeating.sfgate.com/lowlactose-dairy-foods-1822.html) because they tend to be lower in sodium. According to Healthline, brie, blue cheese, camembert (pictured), cream cheese, goat cheese and mascarpone are [examples](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_4) of keto-friendly soft cheeses.

## Greek-style yogurt

Greek yogurt, like cottage cheese, is a “[healthy, high protein food](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_9)” that contains some carbs, but in moderation, can be part of a ketogenic diet. It is processed differently from most yogurt sold in North America. “Greek yogurt makers add an extra step to their process so that excess water, lactose, and minerals drain out,” [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/greek-yogurt-benefits) explains; the resulting product is richer and not as sweet. The protein in yogurt is beneficial to your bones, teeth, muscles, skin and hair, and getting enough protein is also important for immune system support. Greek yogurt also has tons of probiotics, beneficial bacteria which help your immune and digestive systems. Healthline suggests tossing some nuts into your yogurt for a quick and tasty keto treat.

## Walnuts

Nuts and seeds are generally high in fat and low in carbohydrates, making them a [keto-friendly snack](https://ketogenic.com/benefits-of-walnuts-5-reasons-to-eat-walnuts-on-keto/). Walnuts in particular have a [long list of other health benefits](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-walnuts#TOC_TITLE_HDR_14)—they are rich in antioxidants, higher in omega-3s than any other nut, promote gut health and may work to reduce inflammation. They also may help manage diabetes, lower blood pressure and prevent some cancers. There may even be a link between walnuts and healthier sperm. The fact that walnuts are widely available in North America doesn’t hurt. They can be eaten raw as a snack, tossed into salads, added to yogurt or crushed to use as a coating on fish or chicken.

## Berries

If you’re craving fruit while on a keto diet, berries [might be your best option](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_12). “Most fruits are too high in carbs to include on a ketogenic diet, but berries are an exception,” Healthline explains. “Berries are low in carbs and high in fiber [...] and loaded with antioxidants.” [Blueberries](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-proven-benefits-of-blueberries) in particular are some of the most nutrient-dense fruits there are, rich in vitamin C and vitamin K. Eating blueberries may reduce your risk of heart disease and diabetes, and slow age-related cognitive decline. Many low-carb cooking websites, including the blog I Breathe I’m Hungry, have [recipe inspiration](https://www.ibreatheimhungry.com/55-best-keto-blueberry-recipes-low-carb/) for keto-friendly blueberry desserts.

## Butter

Although [traditional low-fat diets](https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/guidelines-for-a-low-cholesterol-low-saturated-fat-diet) advise people to steer clear of butter, it’s considered a [keto-friendly fat](https://keto-mojo.com/article/keto-food-butters-oils/). For years, scientists believed that the high saturated fat content in butter and cream contributed to heart disease, but according to [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_13), some studies now suggest that “a moderate consumption of high fat dairy may possibly reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke.” According to [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-butter#1), butter is also an excellent source of calcium and vitamins A, D and E. It may also reduce the risk of some cancers and slow age-related vision loss.

## Shirataki noodles

While traditional pasta is high in carbs and [generally off the list](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto/foods/update5) of keto-approved foods, [shirataki noodles](https://www.bulletproof.com/diet/keto/shirataki-noodles/) are an exception. These low-carb, high-fibre noodles, which are also gluten-free, are made from the Japanese konjac yam and “consist almost entirely of water and glucomannan fiber (a viscous, soluble dietary fiber).” They look and feel a lot like rice noodles. The fibre in the noodles can help improve digestion, curb hunger and boost cardiovascular health, but the noodles aren’t particularly nutrient-dense, so the healthiness of a shirataki noodle bowl depends on what you put on it. [*Delish*](https://www.delish.com/cooking/g25984873/easy-shirataki-noodles-recipes/) has a few suggestions *(NOTE: recipes are low in carbs but some recipes may not be keto-compliant)*.

## Dark chocolate

If you’re going on a keto diet, prepare to limit your intake of carbs and sugars. That means [cutting out most desserts](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto/foods/update5)—candy, cookies, cakes, pastries, sweetened yogurt, ice cream, honey, maple syrup and even most fruits are off the list. However, dark chocolate is low in carbs, high in antioxidants and keto-friendly in smaller doses. [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_17) advises chocolate seekers to “choose dark chocolate that contains a minimum of 70% cocoa solids, preferably more, and eat in moderation.” Cooking blog [Low Carb Maven](https://www.lowcarbmaven.com/decadent-chocolate-keto-desserts/) has a list of keto-friendly chocolate dessert recipe ideas.

## Beef

Get ready to [eat more meat](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto/foods/update5#meat) when going on a keto diet. According to [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_6), meat and poultry “are considered staple foods on a ketogenic diet, […] contain no carbs and are rich in B vitamins and several important minerals [as well as being] a great source of high-quality protein.” Beef is also a great source of iron, which helps the blood circulate oxygen through the body, and zinc, which supports immune health, according to [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-beef#2). Furthermore, a single four-ounce serving of beef (the equivalent of a quarter-pound burger) can provide a full day’s worth of protein.

## Bacon

[Bacon](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/recipes/bacon), along with other [processed meats](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto/foods/update5#meat) such as sausage, pepperoni and deli ham, is keto-friendly as long as it’s not prepared with added sugars or starches. Although bacon is high in cholesterol and saturated fat, which may increase your long-term risk of heart disease, it’s [actually also nutritious](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/is-bacon-bad-or-good#TOC_TITLE_HDR_4), rich in protein and B vitamins and a decent source of iron, magnesium, zinc and potassium. However, if the idea of [scaling up your consumption of processed meats](https://ketogasm.com/the-bacon-experiment-interview/) makes you uncomfortable, or if you’re trying to eat less salt, [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/is-bacon-bad-or-good#TOC_TITLE_HDR_4) notes that all of the health benefits of bacon can be found in less-processed pork products.

## Cream

Cream, like butter, is a good fat to include on a ketogenic diet, according to [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_13). Cream contains hardly any carbs and is rich in conjugated linoleic acid, a fatty acid which may promote fat loss. Heavy cream is “[full of nutrients](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/heavy-whipping-cream#bottom-line), including fat-soluble vitamins.” When choosing dairy products, Healthline recommends products made with milk from grass-fed cows, which are higher in healthy fats and antioxidants. On the other hand, milk on its own is higher in naturally occurring sugars and [should be avoided,](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto/foods/update5#cheese) except for an occasional spoonful in your coffee.

## Coffee

You won’t have to give up coffee on a keto diet, although you may have to change your coffee shop order. Black coffee is healthy, carb-free and may reduce your risk of diabetes; the caffeine in coffee “increases your metabolism and may help improve your physical performance, alertness, and mood,” according to [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_16). Black coffee or coffee with added heavy cream is keto-friendly, but coffee drinkers should “stay away from ‘light’ coffee and tea lattes” which typically contain flavourings that are high in carbs. Many keto websites offer [variations](https://www.dietdoctor.com/recipes/bulletproof-coffee) on “bulletproof coffee”—a mixture of coffee, butter and coconut oil [inspired by centuries-old recipes](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/bulletproof-coffee-benefits#what-it-is)—for a high-calorie, low-carb, high-caffeine boost.

## Dry wines

Going on a keto diet involves saying goodbye to a lot of popular [alcoholic drinks](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto/alcohol-guide)—most beers, for example, have too many carbs for keto, and sweet wines, unsurprisingly, have too much sugar. “Dry wine (red, rosé, and white) and champagne are keto-friendly in limited amounts,” [Diet Doctor](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto/foods/update5) explains. “Wines that are typically low in carbs are merlot, pinot noir, cabernet, sauvignon blanc, pinot grigio, and chardonnay.” Distilled spirits such as whisky, tequila and vodka also have no carbs, although the sweet juices and sodas they’re often mixed with might. However, “keep in mind that the more alcohol you drink, the harder it is to lose weight because your body has to burn off alcohol calories first.”

## Zucchini

[Zucchini](https://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/low-carb-keto-zucchini-recipes/) and spaghetti squash are [considered keto-friendly vegetables](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_3), and are easy to make into tasty, low-carb pasta substitutes. For zucchini “noodles” (pictured), salt and boil thin strips of zucchini in water and then toss them with your favourite seasonings (here’s a simple suggestion from [*Allrecipes*](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/172398/zucchini-noodles/)). For spaghetti squash, [baking it in the oven](https://cookieandkate.com/how-to-cook-spaghetti-squash/) will bring forth oodles of pasta-like strands which can be seasoned and enjoyed with butter, parmesan or your favourite keto-friendly pasta sauce (here are a [couple of ideas](https://www.lowcarbmaven.com/keto-tomato-sauce/) from Low Carb Maven). Zucchini, called the “[culinary chameleon of the produce world](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-zucchini#1),” can also be [baked, grilled or sautéed](https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/how-to-cook-zucchini-3-easy-ways/) and used as a nutritious veggie side. It’s rich in vitamins, minerals and fibre.

## Shellfish

Most types of shellfish, including clams, mussels, oysters and scallops, are keto-friendly in limited quantities, [low in—but not devoid of—carbs](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto/foods/update5#fish). They are also “high-quality protein sources” and have all the essential amino acids needed to support proper cell function and muscle health, according to [*Time* magazine](https://time.com/5341293/is-shellfish-healthy/). Most shellfish also “have varying amounts of some hard-to-get micronutrients” and are good sources of zinc, copper and iron, *Time* explains. Low-carb cooking website [My Life Cookbook](https://mylifecookbook.com/category/seafood-recipes/) has plenty of keto-compliant recipe ideas involving shellfish.

## Lobster and crab

[Lobster](https://sureketo.com/is-it-keto/lobster) (pictured) and [crab](https://sureketo.com/is-it-keto/dungeness-crab) are keto-friendly, although [both](https://recipes.howstuffworks.com/why-is-lobster-so-expensive-and-will-it-stay-that-way.htm) can be [hard on your wallet](https://www.cookinglight.com/magazine/why-fresh-crabmeat-is-so-expensive), especially if you live far from the coast or are trying to buy them [out of season](https://lobsteranywhere.com/seafood-savvy/best-time-buy-lobster/#:~:text=fishermen to work.-,April%2C May and June,year to buy live lobsters.). Lobster, like other types of shellfish, is [jam-packed with minerals](https://www.consumerreports.org/fish-seafood/is-lobster-good-for-you/); crab is rich in protein, omega-3s and vitamin B12, and studies suggest it can improve heart health and prevent anemia. According to [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-crab#1), research also suggests that people who eat seafood at least once a week have a lower risk of dementia. One thing to watch out for is [how crab and lobster products are prepared](https://globalseafoods.com/blogs/news/seafood-keto-diet)—“[imitation crab](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/imitation-crab),” made from fish, often contains hidden sugars, as does the floury breading served with a lot of restaurant seafood.

## Tomatoes

Tomatoes are [keto-friendly](https://www.delish.com/cooking/nutrition/a27542943/are-tomatoes-keto/) and [versatile](https://www.jamieoliver.com/features/ways-to-use-up-ripe-tomatoes/) to cook with. They are [packed](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/tomatoes) with potassium and vitamins C and K in addition to a substance called [lycopene](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-554/lycopene), which prevents cellular damage, supports immune health and may prevent some cancers. You can eat raw tomatoes as a snack or use them in any number of other dishes including sauces, soups and salads. [Parade](https://parade.com/848445/brendabennett/15-fresh-tasty-low-carb-tomato-recipes/) has a selection of low-carb tomato recipes if you’re looking for inspiration *(NOTE: some recipes may not be keto-compliant)*.

## Cabbage

Cabbage is keto-friendly and loaded with nutrients. According to [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/ss/slideshow-cabbage-benefits), half a cup of cooked cabbage “has about a third the vitamin C you need for the day. It also gives you doses of fiber, folate, potassium, magnesium, vitamins A and K, and more.” It also has plenty of antioxidants. Cabbage has been shown to help prevent heart disease, and the fibre in cabbage aids digestion. It can be served [raw, cooked or fermented](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/recipes/cabbage); you can also use cabbage leaves as a low-calorie, low-carb, heart-healthy [substitute for sandwich bread](https://www.verywellfit.com/calorie-saving-bread-swaps-for-sandwiches-4094304) or tortillas. It has the added benefit of being one of the most inexpensive vegetables around.

## Mushrooms

Mushrooms are [keto-friendly](https://wellversed.in/blogs/articles/are-mushrooms-keto-friendly) and [packed with nutrients and flavour](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-mushrooms#2). They are low in calories and great sources of fibre, protein and minerals including potassium. According to [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-mushrooms#1), studies suggest that incorporating mushrooms into your diet may boost your immune system and support weight loss. They can be cooked with garlic and butter for a delicious side dish, put on pizza or tossed into soups, salads or stir-fries. Cooking blog [Yummy Keto Cooking](https://yummyketocooking.com/keto-mushroom-recipes/) has plenty of earthy, cheesy, flavourful, keto-compliant mushroom inspiration for you.

## Broccoli

Broccoli, like cauliflower, is [keto-compliant](https://www.wholesomeyum.com/is-broccoli-keto/) and [packed with nutrients](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-broccoli) that contribute to a decreased risk of heart disease. According to [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/health-benefits-broccoli#:~:text=Broccoli is a good source,need fibre%2C vitamins and minerals.), broccoli is “a good source of fibre and protein, and contains iron, potassium, calcium, selenium and magnesium as well as the vitamins A, C, E, K and a good array of B vitamins including folic acid.” It also contains certain compounds that support eye health and may reduce the risk of some cancers. It can be eaten raw or cooked (usually steamed or boiled). Diet Doctor has plenty of inspiring keto and low-carb [broccoli recipes](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/recipes/broccoli).

## Spinach

In addition to being [keto-friendly](https://www.ndtv.com/health/keto-diet-why-spinach-and-kale-are-most-nutritious-leafy-greens-for-quick-weight-loss-2038423), spinach has many other health benefits, according to [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/ingredient-focus-spinach). The iron in spinach may help raise your energy levels if you’re feeling tired or rundown, and it has several vitamins and minerals which are important for maintaining healthy bones. Spinach is also naturally rich in nitrates, which support heart health, and polyphenols, which may prevent some cancers. Spinach is [quick and easy to cook](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-cook-spinach): it can be boiled, [sautéed](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/spinach/) or added to egg dishes, just to name a few possibilities. Spinach dip is also a crowd-pleasing classic! Keto cooking website [The Keto Summit](https://ketosummit.com/keto-spinach-recipes/) has more than 30 keto recipes with spinach.

## Asparagus

Asparagus is another [keto-friendly vegetable](https://perfectketo.com/is-asparagus-keto/). [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/asparagus-benefits#TOC_TITLE_HDR_8) states that it’s low in calories and rich in nutrients. Asparagus, which is actually a member of the lily family, is rich in folate and vitamins A, C and K. It also contains a lot of fibre, which is good for digestion and may help prevent high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes. It’s widely available and affordable at most grocery stores in North America, and it’s a versatile vegetable—it “can be cooked in a variety of ways, including boiling, grilling, steaming, roasting and sautéing.” If you’re not sure what to do with your asparagus, low-carb cooking blog [Kalyn’s Kitchen](https://kalynskitchen.com/twenty-favorite-asparagus-recipes/) offers some keto-friendly suggestions.

## Mayonnaise

[Diet Doctor](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto/foods/update5#fats) says rich sauces like garlic butter and mayonnaise can be incorporated into a keto diet. Mayonnaise is made from eggs, oil and spices, and can be store-bought or [homemade](https://www.allrecipes.com/article/making-mayonnaise/). According to the [Food Network](https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/healthy-tips/2011/07/mayo-good-or-bad), mayo is “brimming with fat”—one cup of the creamy white sauce has as much as 160 grams—it’s “an excellent source of vitamins E and K” but is also usually loaded with sodium. Mayo can be made with many different kinds of oil, and some are more keto-friendly and appealing than others; many keto websites sing the praises of [avocado-oil mayo](https://chomps.com/blogs/news/keto-mayo). When buying mayonnaise at the store, try to avoid brands with added sugars and preservatives.

## Lemons & limes

A lot of fruits contain too much sugar to be considered keto-compliant. That’s not the case for lemons and limes, which can add a [delightful tang to keto desserts](https://www.ibreatheimhungry.com/58-best-keto-lemon-dessert-recipes-low-carb/). Lemons are high in vitamin C and soluble fibre. [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/6-lemon-health-benefits#TOC_TITLE_HDR_8) also suggests they may “aid weight loss and reduce your risk of heart disease, anemia, kidney stones, digestive issues, and cancer.” Limes are “[nutritional powerhouses](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/limes#:~:text=Limes are sour%2C round%2C and,kaffir lime (Citrus hystrix).),” also high in vitamin C and antioxidants. While these sour fruits are present in a lot of desserts—think [key lime pie](https://www.myketokitchen.com/keto-recipes/low-carb-key-lime-pie/)—they can also add a flavour boost to savoury dishes.

## Chicken

Chicken, like most types of meat and poultry, is a [keto staple](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto/foods/update5#meat). According to [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-chicken#3), chicken breast is the healthiest part of the bird. The site points out that chicken is a great source of protein and of amino acids, which the body uses to develop muscle tissue. High-protein foods can also make people feel full faster, leading to more effective weight management. Chicken is also a good source of several vitamins and minerals. Don’t shy away from [chicken skin](https://shesgotpower.com/2015/04/6-reasons-why-chicken-skin-is-good-for-you/), which is loaded with healthy fats and protein, and adds flavour and moisture to any chicken dish. Make sure to cook raw or frozen chicken thoroughly to avoid foodborne illness. Diet Doctor has a list of over 100 low-carb, keto-compliant chicken recipes including [casseroles, soups and salads](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/recipes/keto-chicken).

## Macadamia nuts

Nuts and seeds are an easy and healthy [keto snack](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto/snacks). Some nuts are higher in carbs than others, but macadamia nuts and pecans are on the low end of the carb spectrum. According to [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/macadamia-nuts#TOC_TITLE_HDR_2), macadamia nuts have plenty of minerals and beneficial fats. They are also rich in antioxidants that fight inflammation and may help lower cholesterol and prevent certain chronic diseases. The fibre and protein in nuts are good for digestion, reduce hunger and help you feel full and satisfied. Raw or roasted nuts are good as a snack or as a crunchy garnish for soups and salads.

## Eggplant

Eggplant is on [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_3)’s list of keto-compliant vegetables. It’s a good source of fibre and potassium, and also contains antioxidants. Raw eggplant is a little bitter; [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/eggplant-health-benefits) recommends sprinkling salt on sliced eggplant before cooking it to draw some of the bitterness out. Eggplant can be roasted, baked, sautéed, steamed or fried. [Eggplant parmesan](https://www.wholesomeyum.com/eggplant-parmesan-recipe/) is a cheesy, indulgent classic, although the breading adds carbs, which you want to avoid on keto. [The Keto Summit](https://ketosummit.com/keto-eggplant-recipes/) and other sites have keto-friendly recipes for eggplant parmesan and other great eggplant dishes.

## Nut butters

Nut butters can be incorporated into a keto diet, according to [Health.com](https://www.health.com/weight-loss/is-peanut-butter-keto). Peanut butter is relatively high in carbs and needs to be used sparingly. Almond butter (pictured), cashew butter and macadamia nut butter are also worth trying. However, dietitian and Health.com nutrition editor Cynthia Sass advises shoppers to carefully read the label before buying nut butter. While some peanut butter, for example, only contains peanuts and salt, a lot of commercial peanut butter products have additional sugar and oils added. If you have time on your hands, an oven and a blender, you can also try [making your own nut butters](https://minimalistbaker.com/how-to-make-nut-butter/).

## Tea

Like unsweetened coffee, unsweetened tea is [carb-free](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_16). It also provides a mood-boosting, metabolism-increasing dose of caffeine. Healthline suggests adding heavy cream to your tea for a keto kick. [Bulletproof tea](https://lowcarbyum.com/bulletproof-tea/)—tea with added butter and coconut oil, inspired by the traditional [butter tea](https://www.sbs.com.au/food/article/2018/12/24/tibetan-tea-secret-butter-and-salt) (pictured) that sherpas in the Himalayas have enjoyed for centuries—is a filling low-carb, high-fat breakfast idea. However, be wary of sweetened “tea lattes” from coffee shops, which often contain high-carb flavourings.

## Low-carb snacks

A lot of popular snack foods are high in carbs. Chips, popcorn and most sweets are [off the list](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto/foods/update5#foodtoavoid) if you’re sticking to keto or any other low-carb diet. If you’re [craving a snack](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto/snacks), you can always try some nuts or a hard-boiled egg, crunch on some low-carb veggies or make some [cheese](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/260607/basic-keto-cheese-crisps/) or [kale chips](https://www.wholesomeyum.com/recipes/salt-vinegar-kale-chips/). [Diet Doctor](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto/snacks#other) also suggests meat-derived snacks, including pork rinds (pictured), beef jerky and biltong, a kind of dried spiced meat popular in South Africa. When buying commercial beef jerky, make sure to read the label, as “many commercial brands contain sugar and other additives.” You can also [make your own beef jerky](https://www.ketoconnect.net/low-carb-beef-jerky/) in the oven.

## Shrimp

Like crab, lobster and most other kinds of seafood, [shrimp](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/recipes/keto-shrimp-recipes) is keto-friendly. According to [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/shrimp-health-benefits), shrimp are “mostly made up of protein and water.” They’re low in carbs and also provide plenty of minerals, including calcium, potassium, copper, zinc and iron. The antioxidants in shrimp are good for your health and may prevent skin damage. Shrimp can be boiled, steamed, grilled, broiled, sautéed or fried. Try them sautéed with lemon and garlic, or tossed with some zucchini noodles—[*Delish*](https://www.delish.com/cooking/g4841/keto-shrimp-recipes/?slide=1) has a bunch of keto-specific ideas.

## Celery

Celery is a keto-friendly vegetable. It’s low in calories and adds a nice crunch to a lot of dishes, but it also has other health benefits, according to [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/health-benefits-of-celery). It contains vitamin C, beta carotene and other antioxidants. The water and fibre in celery, along with substances called pectin-based polysaccharides, aid digestion and are good for the stomach. It can also neutralize acidic foods. It can be eaten raw as a [snack](https://www.ketoconnect.net/stuffed-celery/), added to soups or stir-fries, or juiced. [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/love-your-leftovers-top-10-ways-use-celery) has a few ideas for how to turn leftover celery into a delicious appetizer or meal *(NOTE: some recipes may not be keto-compliant)*.

## Sunflower seeds

Sunflower seeds are just one of many high-fat, low-carb varieties of nuts and seeds that you can enjoy on a keto diet, according to [Diet Doctor](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto/foods/update5#nuts). They are also [high in vitamin E](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/sunflower-seeds) (a one-ounce serving provides nearly 40% of your recommended daily intake of vitamin E), vitamin B6, and minerals including niacin, zinc, copper and folate. According to [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/sunflower-seeds#benefits), studies suggest that eating sunflower seeds may help lower blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar. Sunflower seeds can be [eaten](https://perfectketo.com/are-sunflower-seeds-keto/) raw or roasted as a snack, but you can also mix them into salads, granola, pesto and other sauces, or vegetarian burger patties. [Epicurious](https://www.epicurious.com/ingredients/8-ways-to-use-sunflower-seeds-article) has some ideas *(NOTE: some recipes may not be keto-compliant)*.

## Ghee

Ghee shows up in a lot of keto recipes as an alternative to butter, but what exactly is it? As the [Perfect Keto blog](https://perfectketo.com/butter-or-ghee-which-is-better-for-keto/) explains, “ghee, the Hindi word for ‘fat,’ is clarified butter, but cooked just a bit longer. When you remove the butter from the heat as soon as the separation of butterfat and milk solids occur, you end up with clarified butter. When you wait until the milk solids start to caramelize, that’s ghee. Cooking it longer gives ghee that deep golden color, and the caramelized milk solids [are] the source of that distinct nutty flavor.” Ghee is rich in a form of fat called medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) which are easily digestible and reduce appetite. It also has less lactose than butter. Whether your ghee is store-bought or [homemade](https://www.dietdoctor.com/recipes/ghee), you end up with pure butter fat. It enhances the flavour of spicy dishes and is especially good in stir-fries; it also “[adds a rich, sweet and caramel flavor](https://perfectketo.com/butter-or-ghee-which-is-better-for-keto/)” to [keto coffee](https://irenamacri.com/recipes/bulletproof-coffee/).

## Almond milk

According to [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/almond-milk-keto#:~:text=Unsweetened almond milk contains just 1.4 grams of carbs and,into a healthy keto diet.), unsweetened almond milk is low in carbs and usually keto-friendly. Its use as a nutritious alternative to dairy dates back to medieval times in Europe, according to [*Smithsonian*](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/nut-milks-are-milk-says-almost-every-culture-across-globe-180970008/#:~:text=Ken Albala%2C professor of history,century%2C and their milk—yes), and it and other nut milks have been popular for decades with vegetarians, vegans and others who don’t want to or can’t consume dairy, as [Vegan Food and Living](https://www.veganfoodandliving.com/features/a-brief-history-of-plant-milks/) explains. Almond milk “[is probably the most widely used milk on keto,](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/is-milk-keto#keto-friendly-choices)” because it’s low in carbs and often easier to find than other nut milks. Coconut milk and soy milk are also worth a try, and so are macadamia nut milk, cashew milk, flaxseed milk and pea milk, if you can find them. If you have time and a food processor or blender, you can also [make almond milk at home](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-almond-milk-at-home-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-189996).

## Hard cheeses

Plenty of hard and semi-hard cheeses are keto-friendly. Cheddar, halloumi, Havarti, mozzarella, muenster, parmesan, provolone, Romano and Swiss cheese are [all on the list](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_4). Keto [potato chip and pizza crust alternatives](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/recipes/cheese) can be made from hard cheeses (these recipes use [cheddar-provolone-edam](https://www.dietdoctor.com/recipes/keto-cheese-chips) and [mozzarella-parmesan](https://www.dietdoctor.com/recipes/sullivans-kedough-breakfast-pizza) cheese blends, respectively). Halloumi (pictured), a [semi-hard cheese from Cyprus](https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-halloumi-cheese-3376845) that holds its shape when grilled, can be barbecued or used to make potato-less [cheese fries](https://www.dietdoctor.com/recipes/halloumi-fries-with-avocado-dip). There are hundreds of different kinds of cheeses, so now might be a great time to experiment with one you’ve never tried before! One word of warning—[Diet Doctor](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto/foods/update5#cheese) cautions that “snacking on cheese when you’re not hungry is a common mistake that can slow down weight loss.”

## Organ meat

Liver has been called “[one of America’s most hated foods](https://www.forbes.com/sites/victoriavonbiel/2011/10/24/americas-most-hated-food-and-why-you-should-try-to-love-it/?sh=38b7c06f6fd3),” and maybe you’re one of the many people who can’t stand its earthy flavour and distinct texture, but there’s no denying its nutritional benefits. Organ meats (the liver, kidneys, heart and other internal organs of an animal killed for meat) are some of the [most nutrient-dense food](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/organ-meats#:~:text=Organ Meats Are Highly Nutritious&text=They are particularly rich in,are an excellent protein source.) humans eat. Liver in particular is full of vitamin A, vitamin B12, folate, zinc, copper and iron. Heart is high in iron and zinc and rich in antioxidants. Tongue is high in minerals and fat, making it “a great option for high-fat ketogenic diets,” according to [Perfect Keto](https://perfectketo.com/offal/). Tripe (intestine) is full of protein, and brain is high in fat and a great source of omega-3s. Perfect Keto suggests eating one serving of liver a week. This [keto-friendly chili](https://perfectketo.com/keto-chili/) is one way to get more organ meat in your diet. Here are some recipes and tips for simply and safely cooking [liver](https://asweetlife.org/14-nourishing-keto-liver-recipes/), [heart](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/03/the-nasty-bits-beef-heart-4-ways-stew-seared-or-grilled-burgers-french-fries.html), [kidneys](https://vintagerecipesandcookery.com/how-to-cook-kidneys/), [tripe](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-cook-with-tripe), [tongue](https://omnivorescookbook.com/beef-tongue-recipes/) and [brains](https://offallygoodcooking.com/brains/) *(NOTE: some recipes may not be keto-compliant)*.

## Lamb

Lamb, like most meats, is [keto-friendly](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto/foods). [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/lamb#bottom-line) suggests that meat eaters stick to grass-fed lamb and other meats because animals that eat grass produce [more omega-3s](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/grass-fed-vs-grain-fed-beef#differences). Lamb is an excellent source of protein and rich in saturated fats. It’s also a great source of many vitamins and minerals, including vitamin B12, iron, niacin, phosphorus and zinc. The protein in lamb supports muscle mass and muscle function. Lamb can be roasted, grilled or slow-cooked in a delicious stew. Here are a few lamb [recipe ideas](https://www.ibreatheimhungry.com/50-best-low-carb-keto-lamb-recipes/), inspired by British, French, Indian, North African and Greek cooking.

## Cucumbers

Cucumbers are on [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_3)’s list of low-carb, keto-approved vegetables. Raw cucumbers have plenty of water—which helps keep you hydrated—and fibre, which aids digestion. According to [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/cucumber-health-benefits), they also have lots of vitamin K, vitamin C and potassium. Cucumbers are usually eaten raw, as a snack or tossed into salads. You can also [make homemade pickles](https://cookieandkate.com/best-pickles-recipe/) with your leftover cucumbers ([sour or dill pickles](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/pickles-on-keto#:~:text=Pickles can be keto-friendly,and bread and butter ones.) from the supermarket are usually keto-safe, but some varieties contain added sugar). *The Guardian* [has a lot of ideas](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/22/20-recipe-ideas-for-leftover-cucumber) about what to do with leftover cucumbers, including soups, stir-fries, creative twists on pickling and even a sorbet *(NOTE: some recipes may not be keto-compliant)*.

## Green beans

Green beans are another [suitable vegetable](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_3) for keto. According to the [Old Farmer’s Almanac](https://www.almanac.com/green-beans-so-good-you#:~:text=Green Beans Health Benefits,%2C skin%2C and hair).), “not only are green beans a nice, crunchy, low-calorie food but they also provide many key nutrients. Young, tender green beans are a good source of vitamin C, dietary fiber, folate, vitamin K and silicon (needed for healthy bones, skin, and hair).” Green beans are easy to find at farmers’ markets in North America in the summer. Eat your green beans raw or [toss them](https://lifemadeketo.com/skillet-green-beans/) into a [casserole](https://www.lowcarbmaven.com/supreme-green-bean-casserole/), [soup](https://www.debbiemakeslowcarbdelicious.com/post/cream-of-green-bean-soup-low-carb-keto), [stir-fry](https://howtothisandthat.com/keto-green-bean-chicken-stir-fry-recipe/) or [salad](https://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/keto-green-bean-salad/). If you have a surplus, you can freeze them or pickle them (without adding sugar).

## Some melons

Your fruit options are limited on a keto diet, but [cantaloupe](https://www.everydayhealth.com/ketogenic-diet/diet/best-fruits-eat-on-keto-diet/#:~:text=Cantaloupe&text=Another appropriate fruit on the,in sugar%2C with 6.3 g.) (pictured) and [watermelon](https://www.thekitchn.com/is-watermelon-keto-friendly-23038133) are safe choices. Both are low in calories and carbs. Cantaloupes are rich in vitamins A and C. Watermelons aren’t quite as nutrient-dense, but they make a refreshing, satisfying keto-friendly sweet treat. Cooking blog [Step Away from the Carbs](https://stepawayfromthecarbs.com/cantaloupe-arugula-and-feta-salad/) has one tempting recipe for a low-carb fruit salad with cantaloupe and feta cheese. [Perfect Keto](https://perfectketo.com/are-melons-keto/) points out that melons are higher in carbs than most keto treats, so should be enjoyed sparingly. [Epicurious](https://www.epicurious.com/ingredients/sweet-and-savory-cantaloupe-recipes-gallery) and [Respect Food](https://www.respectfood.com/article/how-to-waste-less-and-use-up-an-entire-watermelon/) have some inspiration if you’re looking for things to do with your leftover cantaloupe and watermelon—try melon salad, melon salsa, melon ice or barbecued melon *(NOTE: some recipes may not be keto-compliant)*.

## Kale

Not only is kale [keto-compliant](https://www.ndtv.com/health/keto-diet-why-spinach-and-kale-are-most-nutritious-leafy-greens-for-quick-weight-loss-2038423), it’s “one of the most nutrient-dense foods on the planet,” according to [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-proven-benefits-of-kale). One cup of raw kale provides more than 100% of the vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin K that you need in a day, and contains smaller amounts of many vitamins and minerals including B vitamins, manganese, calcium, copper, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus and iron (which many people don’t get enough of), as well as a lot of antioxidants. “Kale contains very little fat, but a large portion of the fat in it is an omega-3 fatty acid called alpha linolenic-acid.” Healthline suggests baking kale with olive or avocado oil and salt to make [kale chips](https://www.wholesomeyum.com/recipes/salt-vinegar-kale-chips/), or adding it to salads or smoothies. [The Keto Summit](https://ketosummit.com/keto-kale-recipes/) has a treasure trove of keto-compliant kale recipes including soups, salads, pesto and egg dishes.
